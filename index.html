    <h1>New Submission Experience Guide for JM</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Purpose and Benefits</h2>
        <p>
            The purpose of this document is to guide JMs through the steps involved in Editorial Manager’s (EM) new submission experience.<br>
            The new submission experience simplifies the process by only requesting relevant information early on, recognizing that most authors don’t advance past the desk decision.<br>
            Authors want a faster submission experience without too many requirements and EM’s new submission experience allows for this. Subsequently, EM’s new submission experience should reduce the number of submissions sent back to author with the reduced requirements and by building completeness checks.<br>
            System navigation is improved as authors are guided through a simplified submission process, with a clear map showing where they are at any given moment.<br>
            The new submission experience is a key step to roll out the HTML version of the manuscript (Interactive Content Article), which will enable alignment of the manuscript to a unified format and facilitate checks for any missing elements.<br>
            When the ICA version of the article is created as part of the new submission experience (this is in development but not yet available), it will be available for authors to review and subsequently Editors and reviewers to use.
        </p>

        <h2>1. EM’s New Submission Experience</h2>
        <h3>What is EM’s New Submission Experience?</h3>
        <p>
            EM’s new submission experience is a simplified submission system that sits outside of EM and authors need to use their ID+ login credentials to login instead of logging in to EM. A single ID+ account allows authors to submit to all EM’s new submission experience journals.<br>
            EM’s new submission experience has been developed to improve the manuscript submission journey for authors.<br>
            Currently the system only handles the initial submission by the author. On submission it is transferred to EM via the ingest service.<br>
            EM’s new submission experience is being actively developed and will see changes over the course of 2025 and 2026.<br>
            Long-term intention is that this can be utilized by third party publishers.
        </p>

        <h3>Scope</h3>
        <p>
            EM’s new submission experience currently supports only original and special issue submissions of regular article types. It does not support article transfer submissions and Invited workflow (proposals) submissions.<br>
            EM’s new submission experience does not support revisions and send back to author submissions workflows.<br>
            EM’s new submission experience supports the following workflows:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Central Receiving Office (CRO) workflow where submissions are received in New Submissions/ New Submission Requiring Assignment Folder</li>
            <li>Direct-to-Editor workflow using Section Categories and Rotation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Journal Requirements to Rollout to EM’s New Submission Experience</h3>
        <p>
            EM’s new submission experience submissions are directed to EM via the ingest service. Hereafter the submission follows the regular EM workflow.<br>
            EM’s new submission experience does not currently support revisions, but this is something that will be supported in the future.<br>
            EM’s new submission experience follows the configurations as set within EM.

        <h3>Submission Item Types</h3>
        <p>
            Journals rolling out to EM’s new submission experience use a standard list of Submission Item Types (SITs).<br>
            The SITs used on your journal(s) are mapped against the new list of SIT names.<br>
            In some instances, several of the current SIT names are consolidated into a single new SIT name. In these cases, only one new SIT replaces all the previous ones (example: “MATLAB files”, “Phylogenetic trees” and “Supplementary material” all map to one new SIT “Supplementary material”).<br>
            Some SITs are being retired because ScienceDirect no longer displays 3D models, which impacts their performance.<br>
            The current settings for SITs in terms of whether they are set as ‘Required’, ‘Optional’, or ‘Hidden’ are carried over and remain the same once your journal is rolled out to the new submission experience.
        </p>
        <h4>Adding or Changing SITs in EM</h4>
        <p>
            Once a journal is selected for roll out to EM’s new submission experience, the SIT names are updated via a script.<br>
            Do not modify the SITs as they are mapped to corresponding SITs in the new submission experience.<br>
            Any inconsistencies disrupt the submission workflow.<br>
            If a change or new SIT is required, raise this with your team lead or APS in the first instance. APS can contact the Journal Configuration Governance mailbox for further guidance.<br>
            Raise a ticket to APS via OSvC with the prefix “[NSE]” in the subject line.
        </p>

        <h3>Submissions Questions</h3>
        <p>
            For journals on EM’s new submission experience, all authors are redirected to EM’s new submission experience to submit.<br>
            Submission questions in EM are no longer applicable. However, information from the author must be passed from EM’s new submission experience back to EM.<br>
            Before a journal rolls out to EM’s new submission experience, a backend script hides the current questionnaires in EM and replaces them with a questionnaire aligned with the new submission experience (only listing the questions for which information needs to be passed back).
        </p>
        <h4>Which Submission Questions Are Available in the New Submission Experience?</h4>
        <p>
            A new standard list of submission questions (Submission questions in Editorial Manager) and requirements (Submission Requirements for Authors) have been composed based on analysis of current questions in EM and the guide for authors.<br>
            The questions have been reviewed and approved by the Governance Board.<br>
            These questions have been passed on to the new submission experience as business requirements for the submission process and are under development.<br>
            In the future, there will be a possibility for society journals to add custom questions.
        </p>
        <h4>Adding or Changing Submission Questions in EM</h4>
        <p>
            You can no longer change or add submission questions once a journal has rolled out to the new submission experience except for the following standard submission questions:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Question regarding the Data Availability Statement</li>
            <li>Question regarding SSRN</li>
            <li>Declaration confirming that no authors are Editors of the journal</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Before they can be added, JMs must contact the Leap mailbox.<br>
            The SHINE Journal Configuration team creates the below questionnaires as part of the roll out to NSE action.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>NSE 1: Contains the Data Availability Statement (DAS) question</li>
            <li>NSE 2: Contains the DAS and the SSRN questions</li>
            <li>NSE 3: Contains the SSRN question</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The above questionnaires are not created by default for all journals. They are created if the DAS and/or the SSRN question is already configured within the journal and presented to the author during the submission process. See configuration details below:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The journal has only the DAS question configured - NSE 1 is configured.</li>
            <li>The journal has only the SSRN question configured - NSE 3 is configured.</li>
            <li>The journal has both the DAS and SSRN questions configured - NSE 2 is configured.</li>
            <li>The journal has neither the DAS nor the SSRN question configured - No NSE questionnaires are configured. All the current questionnaires are hidden.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="note">
            <strong>NOTE:</strong> Depending on the current configuration within the article type, the relevant NSE questionnaires are linked. For example, the article type Research Paper, prior to the NSE roll out, had ‘SSRN Questionnaire’ configured for new submissions and ‘Author Questionnaire (DAS + others)’ for revised submissions. Post the NSE roll out, the journal would display the configuration within the article type as NSE 3 for new submissions and as NSE 1 for revised submissions.
        </div>
        <div class="important">
            IMPORTANT: Special Issues and Reviews are not delivered to SSRN so these article types must not have the SSRN questionnaire configured.
        </div>
        <p>
            If there is a need for an additional submission question to be added to the standard list for the new submission experience implementation, then contact your site APS with a valid business reason via OSvC with the prefix “[NSE]” in the subject line.<br>
            APS validate the request to check if an alternative method can be used instead of adding a new submission question.<br>
            APS must contact the Journal Configuration Governance team with the request, stating the submission question and the business justification for further guidance/approval.

            The only author parameter fields that can be set as ‘Required’ (they can be made ‘Optional’ or ‘Hidden’) are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>E-Mail address</li>
            <li>Institution</li>
            <li>Family/Last Name</li>
            <li>Given/First Name</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Submissions get stuck if more fields are set as ‘Required’ other than those listed above, as NSE only supports collecting author details for these fields.

        <h3>Creating Special Issues in EM and Best Practice for Article Type Amendments</h3>
        <p>
            Specific restrictions apply when editing multiple article types and creating special issue article types when a journal is rolled out to EM’s new submission experience. See Best Practice for Article Type Amendments for further guidance.

        <h2>Post-Rollout JIF Update</h2>
        <p>
            Once your journal has rolled out to EM’s new submission experience, add the following to your JIF to make sure that no restricted changes are made in EM:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>This journal is rolled out to EM’s new submission experience. Do not make any changes to the following in EM without consulting EM's new submission experience JM champions (see JM Champions) first:</li>
            <li>Do not make any updates to the custom questionnaires (addition/amendment/deletion of any questions). If any questions need to be added, then Journal Managers must contact their site APS team (via OSvC with the prefix “[NSE]” in the subject line) as per the IKB procedure ‘JM Guide for Editorial Manager’s New Submission Experience’.</li>
            <li>Do not make any changes in the ‘Article Type Parameters’ or ‘Field Size Limitations’ settings listed in the ‘Edit Article Types’ section in the IKB procedure.</li>
            <li>Do not add any new submission item types in EM except those listed in the standard Submission Item Types list found in the IKB procedure.</li>
            <li>Do not change the journal workflow to Direct-to-Editor Author choice (where the Author selects an Editor).</li>
            <li>Do not make any changes in EM in the System Administrator Functions > Submission Policies > Set Other Author Parameters page as mentioned in the ‘Set Other Author Parameters’ section in the IKB procedure ‘JM Guide for Editorial Manager’s New Submission Experience’.</li>
            <li>Do not enable features marked as ‘not yet supported’ in the table named ‘Editorial Manager’s new submission experience features’ in the IKB procedure.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Post-Rollout Restricted EM Changes</h2>
        <p>
            Once a journal adopts EM’s new submission experience, certain changes require prior approval from APS (raise a task to APS via OSvC to confirm feasibility). Unauthorized changes can cause submission issues, as information will mismatch, preventing successful processing through the journal’s workflow.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Journal Workflow: Do not change the Journal workflow to Direct-to-Editor Author choice (where the Author selects an Editor).</li>
            <li>Edit Article Types: Do not make any changes in the ‘Article Type Parameters’ or ‘Field Size Limitations’ settings as mentioned in the Edit Article Types section above.</li>
            <li>Edit Submission Items: Do not add any new submission item types in EM except those listed in the Submission Item Types section above.</li>
            <li>Create/Edit Custom Question/Questionnaires: Do not make any changes to the existing submission questions/questionnaires as mentioned in the Submission Questions section above.</li>
            <li>Do not make any changes in EM in the System Administrator Functions > Submission Policies > Set Other Author Parameters page as mentioned in ‘Set Other Author Parameters’.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="note">
            NOTE: JMs covering your journals also need to be made aware of the above. Also, if you transfer your journal to a new JM, you need to highlight that the journal is on EM’s new submission experience, and the covering JM needs to read this procedure and attend the monthly calls. For further information and monthly invitations, contact the JM champions.<br>
            <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Configuration changes are possible in EM for journals rolled out to EM’s new submission experience, however, to confirm feasibility, raise a task to APS via OSvC.

        <h2>Rollout Delay/Rollback</h2>
        <p>
            The Non Solus page ‘Leap roll out information’ aimed at Publishers regarding Leap rollouts may also be useful for JMs.<br>
            To request a rollout delay or raise any concerns after rollout to EM’s new submission experience, Publishers can contact the Leap Rollout mailbox.<br>
            JMs can also contact the Leap Rollout mailbox if they get Editor concerns after rollout.
        </p>
        <h3>Rollback Steps</h3>
        <p>
            To request rollback for a journal, the Publisher must contact the Leap Rollout mailbox and include the EM acronym, Title and the reason for roll back (include data if available).<br>
            Once the rollback is approved by the Leap Team/Publisher, contact APS via an OSvC incident using the following template to initiate the rollback process. Include the approval e-mail(s) as attachment(s).
        </p>
        <div class="note">
            <strong>Subject:</strong> [NSE FULL ROLLBACK] [EM Acronym] [Request to rollback the journal]<br>
            Journal PTS acronym:<br>
            EM acronym:<br>
            Journal Title:<br>
            Rollback date:<br>
            Rollback reason:<br>
            What actions have been taken to prevent the rollback:<br>
            Approval from the LEAP team attached: Yes/No
        </div>
        <p>
            Once APS confirms that the journal has been rolled back, de-link the NSE questionnaire linked to the article types and reinstate the previous questionnaire configured for the journal.<br>
            For example, if the previous questionnaire linked to the article types was Author Questionnaire, then replace the NSE Questionnaire with the Author Questionnaire for all active article types within the journal.<br>
            Do not re-enable any hidden SITs. If there is a need for an additional SIT, consult with APS to see if there is an alternative in the standard list. If no such alternative exists, contact the Journal Configuration Governance team.<br>
            Update JIF with details of the rollback.
